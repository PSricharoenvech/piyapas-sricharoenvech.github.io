<h2>About</h2>
<p>
<strong>Piyapas Sricharoenvech</strong> is a Lecturer in the Department of Soil Science
at Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand. Her research lies in the field of
environmental soil chemistry, with a focus on understanding the fate,
transformation, and availability of metals and nutrients in soils impacted
by sea-level rise and salinity intrusion.
</p>

<p>
Her work combines conventional chemical extraction techniques with advanced
synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate soil chemical
processes at both bulk and molecular scales.
