<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
My research focuses on environmental soil chemistry, with particular
interest in the fate and transformation of metals and nutrients in soils
impacted by sea-level rise.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Methods commonly used:</strong>
Routine chemical extractions, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).
</p>
  
<h2>Ongoing Research</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Effects of Salinity from Saltwater Intrusion on the Availability, Speciation, and Release of Phosphorus in Soils in Durian Orchards in Nonthaburi Province, Thailand</strong><br>
    Use several chemical extractions and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate how a increase in salinity impacts soil phosphorus speciation and release from agricultural soils.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Potential of Biochar for Removing Microplastics from Agricultural Runoff</strong><br>
    Evaluate the potential of biochar as a low-cost filter for microplastics in agricultural runoff water.
